Live Support Desk allows you to host voice, text, and video chats right in your WordPress site. Clients can connect with you and your team in one click.

== Description ==

Live Support Desk puts voice, text, and video chats right in your WordPress site. It’s quick and easy to set up and use. Our plugin is designed to work whether you are on your own or have a team of agents. This is the live support solution for everybody. 

*   Our intuitive configuration menu lets you quickly insert live chat windows right into the your site. You just select your preferences and the short code is generated for you. 

*   When people visit your site they’ll see clickable chat windows right in the pages you choose. One click and they’re connected to someone who is ready to help them out. This all happens without a visitor ever needing to download an external application or leave your site. 

*   You can control every aspect of the chat. Choose between video and voice chats, or even text only chats. You can also choose to enable or disable text chatting as part of your voice or video chats. The plugin also allows you to use different chat styles in different pages. 

*   Our clean, neutral interface looks natural in the page. Customize everything from the size of the display to the features that appear in the window. 

*   Add agent logins and define their roles. Specify which chat windows are designated to which roles and streamline requests to the right agents.  

*   Set up an agent chat window so that you don’t even have to give employees access to your WordPress Dashboard. An agent only has to log into one page to receive any chat requests they are assigned to handle. 

*   Choose whether or not to give your visitors and agents control of their media functions, such as cutting their web cam or audio feed with just the click of a button. 

*   You can use a waiting queue that lets clients know their place in line. For smaller businesses you can even use a regular Accept/Ignore request management style that notifies you when somebody wants to chat. 

*   When nobody is online you can choose to display a custom page in place of the chat window.

*   This plugin provides you with the tools you need for providing personal, quick, and easy support.

Download the plugin right here in the WordPress Plugin Directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WHERE DO I FIND MY API KEY? =

*   Your API Key is found in your application details in the manage account section. When you configure the plugin you create an account, as well as an application. When you create your application you are given an API Key.

*   Just go to manage account in the Live Support Desk tab on your Dashboard and click on your application. You’ll see your API Key there.

*If you haven’t set up your developer account or your application, you can see how to do this by reading the instructions on the installation page, or in the how-to guides on our website.*

= DOES THE BASIC PLAN INCLUDE ALL THE FEATURES? =

Yes. All the pricing plans that service our WordPress plugin include all the plugin features. 

We know that most small businesses around the world are made up of one employee. When we were creating this plugin we noticed that there was no solution for these really small businesses. The number of employees shouldn’t determine the features your company’s website is able to have. A lot of other solutions don’t offer all their features with their cheapest plans. They also require you to talk with a sales agent to get set up. We want it to be easy for everyone to get exactly what they need right away.

= DO I HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERY AGENT ID I CREATE? =

No. Creating agent IDs is just a feature of the plugin. You can have as many agent logins as you want. When you’re paying for additional agents, you’re paying for the number of simultaneously connected agents you need.

Our pricing model is structured around the number of agents you have logged in at the same time.

You might have 8 employees, but only ever have 4 working at the same time. You don’t need to pay for 8 agents if you aren’t going to have 8 agents logged in at once. Just pay for the maximum number of agents you would have logged in at once.

Just make sure your agents log out at the end of their shifts. This will prevent it from looking like there are agents available when there actually aren’t. It will also ensure that all of your agents in later shifts are able to connect.

= WILL THE PLUGIN WORK ON A MOBILE DEVICE? =

The plugin will work on an Android device. Unfortunately WebRTC isn’t compatible with Safari yet, so it won’t work on an iPhone or iPad. 

= WILL THE PLUGIN WORK ON ANY BROWSER? =

The plugin works on any browser that supports WebRTC, and some browsers don’t support WebRTC yet.

The most common desktop browsers, Chrome and Firefox, support WebRTC. 

Notable browsers that don’t support the plugin are Internet Explorer and Safari.

In addition to being available on Chrome and Firefox, the plugin will also work on Opera. While it is not available on Safari or Internet Explorer, most expect these browsers (and Edge, Microsoft’s next browser) to integrate WebRTC as demand grows. You can also install WebRTC browser plugins that make it work on Safari or Explorer.

= IS THERE A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME I CAN SPEND IN A CALL, OR THE NUMBER OF CALLS I CAN HOST? =

The plans for WordPress users are unlimited. You’ll never have to shut down customer support or reschedule appointments because you’re running low on calls or minutes. Feel free to take the time you need with your clients and visitors. There are so many different uses for these solutions that the only one size fits all plan is unlimited.

That being said, our service is subject to fair use. We didn’t put a number on this because every business is different. We understand that you can’t control the number of requests that come your way, or how long it takes to resolve an issue. 

There’s no problem with having a lot of clients and getting a lot of requests. But we can tell the difference between a thriving business with a high volume of requests, and a site that is gaming our system. If we get the sense that you are abusing our service, your account will be subject to termination.

= CAN I MAKE A CALL TOWARDS SOMEONE ELSE? =

This is an incoming request solution. If people want to get in touch with you they will now be able to contact you right in your site. You’ll still have to reach out to people by going towards them.


= WHAT IS WEBRTC? =

WebRTC is the Word Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) open-source real time communications standard. It enables in-browser real time communications between anyone connected to the internet. WebRTC aims to eliminate the need for external applications and browser plugins, bringing real time communications right into the browser.

Unlike other solutions, WebRTC is supported in the browser itself so there’s no need for users to constantly update plugins, or download external applications. What’s more, you won’t need a special hosting solution to have video chats in your site. The chat window is a built-in part of your webpage. As an open-source project, WebRTC provides flexibility for developers and invites the best minds to work on this standard. The user experience for WebRTC is simple: Click on the desired communications interface and you’re connected. WebRTC is a peer-to-peer solution, so the servers hosting your website won’t be taking on a huge burden.

Here are some resources to help you get started.

= Creating Agents and Roles =

This is where you create login IDs for your agents, and roles that you will assign to chat windows and agents.

1. **Live Support Desk Dashboard Tab** - Hover over the Live Support Desk tab on your Dashboard. Click on Manage Agents.

2. **Manage Agents** - Click Add at the top of the page. The login is the username that an agent will enter when he or she logs in. You'll need to assign roles to that agent. "Support" is a default role that you can use as a placeholder if you haven't created any of your own roles yet. The role or roles that you assign to this agent will determine which chat windows they receive chat requests from. They'll receive all incoming requests from chat windows matching their roles.

3. **Roles** - Create the roles you assign to agents and chat windows. A role is a designation that you give to an agent or chat window to determine where chat requests go. You can add as many roles as you want to an agent. A chat window can only have 1 role. Set up roles for chat windows or pages in your site, and then assign the role to qualified agents.

4. **Manage Roles** - Hover back over the Live Support Desk tab on the Dashboard sidebar. Click on Manage Roles. Click Add at the top of the page. All you have to do is give a name to the role you'd like to add and click Add Role. You can then assign these roles to agents and chat windows. When you are creating roles, just think of the function that you'd like a particular chat window to fill.

*Chat requests are sent to agents from chat windows matching their roles. All agents receive all requests from chat windows with their matching roles.*



= Setting up a Chat Window =

*This is a lot of text, but this can all be done in just a few seconds once you know what you're doing.*

**Access your WordPress Dashboard** - Find Live Support Desk in the settings tab on your dashboard. Configuring the plugin with your API Key is a one time thing. No need to worry about that again.

*   Decide what type of "Request Management Settings" you'd like to use. For a smaller business we recommend using Direct Connect. If you have lots of agents connected at once, it will be more effective to use a Waiting Queue style.

*The Request Management Settings decide how incoming requests are processed by agents. If you have a Waiting Queue, calls will be put in a first come, first served queue. An agent just clicks on a prompt to take the next request in line. Direct Connect is more like a standard call. Agents will be notified of an incoming request and can decide whether to Accept/Ignore.*

*Note: If you change this setting it will change the Request Management Style for all the chat windows on your site. This is not assigned on a window to window basis.*  

**Unavailable Message** - You can create a custom page with a personalized message that will appear in place of the chat window if nobody is available. You can use this feature to direct clients to a page of your choice when nobody is online. If you don't want to do that, you can just display our default message.

*Keep in mind that people will still be able to join the queue if all agents are in a chat.* 

*Note: Setting up Screen Sharing is also one of the options on the settings page. We have a separate How-to for that. It isn't necessary to set this up to start using the other features.* 

**Pages** - Once you've Saved Your Changes in the settings, go to Pages in the Dashboard side bar and choose a page where you'd like to insert a chat window. You can do this on a new page or an existing page. You can do this all over your site, on as many pages as you want, with as many different types of chat windows as you'd like.

*   Above the text editor you'll see a Live Support Desk icon. Click on that icon and configure your chat window from the options in the short code generator. It will say "Create Chat Window" at the top.

*   Create Chat Window - You'll see that there are several options to choose from on the short code generator. We'll break it down step by step.

**Type** - Choose between "Customer" or "Agent" windows. When you select "Customer" you will be creating the type of chat window that a visitor will see. They just have to click on it to request a chat. By selecting "Agent" you'll be setting up an agent-facing window that will present agents with a login screen. Agents will be eligible to receive chat requests through the window just by navigating to the page where you put it and logging in. This makes it so you don't have to give agents access to your WordPress Dashboard.

**Role** - You're choosing what this chat is for. Choose which agents will receive requests from this particular chat window. When agents are logged in, they are able to receive chat requests pertaining to their assigned roles. If you assign this window with Support, any agent who has the assigned role of Support will receive requests from this window. Agents can have multiple roles, so if you're limited on agents you can have agents receive requests from multiple chat windows.

*Note: When you select an Agent window the Role menu is greyed out. This is because this menu only affects customer-facing windows. Agent windows are role neutral to limit the amount that you have to create. An agent who is logged into the agent window will receive any chat requests that pertain to the agent's assigned roles.* 

**Layout** - This menu lets you choose the style of chat window you'd like to display. You can decide whether you'd like to have the controls and the self-facing display on the right or left side in side-to-side layouts. You can also choose vertical for a layout with a more prominent video stream. You can also use text-only chat.

**Media Source** - Choose the quality of the video resolution here. You can also select an audio-only chat window if that fits your needs better. As with anything, the quality of your image and audio will also largely depend on the power of participating machines and their connections.

*Don't be overly ambitious with the quality you select. In order for the plugin to function at its best you should select appropriate settings. While the plugin is capable of great quality, it won't magically make a computer more powerful or an internet connection faster.*

**Enable Text Chat** - Keep this box checked if you'd like text chat to be enabled in the window. This allows you to have a text chat going with the person you are talking to in voice or video chats.

**Enable Media Controls** - Have this box checked to give a client or agent the ability to cut their microphone, camera, or sound. If you'd like these controls disabled just make sure this box is unchecked.

*Disabling text chat and media controls might be useful if you want a really basic looking chat window integrated into your page. This will remove the icons that surround the video feed. We keep the chat window clean to begin with, but this just enables you to have a simpler interface if that's what you need.*  

**Enable Screen Sharing** - Check this box to enable screen-sharing when it is configured. This process is a little more involved, and requires a couple extra steps. There is a detailed explanation in the How-to guides.

**Chat Window Width/Height** - These two spaces let you define the size of the chat window. You can either set a size in Pixels or a % of the available page space. Tinker with this to find a size that works. The size of the window will max out at 100% of the available space if you set a number of pixels that is too large.

*Note: If you set the window really small the chat features and media controls will not be visible.*

**Insert Short Code** - The chat window (in the form of short code) will be inserted into the text box in your page editor.

**Test It Out** - Open up a private browsing window and navigate to the page you just configured the chat window for.

*   Once you've done that go back to the browser window where your Dashboard is open and go to the Live Support Desk icon in your Dashboard Sidebar. Click on Desk.

*   Go back to the private window and refresh the page. You will give access to your microphone and webcam by simply clicking the prompt.

*   Click on the chat window and you'll receive a request in the Live Support Desk. Accept the request and you have hosted a video chat (or another kind of chat) with yourself.

*To test an agent window just follow this same process in reverse. Keep a customer window configured and open up both the agent window and the customer window in private browsing windows. Log into the agent-facing window. Go back to your customer window and send yourself a chat request.*

*NOTE: Make sure the agent ID you use for your test has the role that you assigned to the customer chat window you are testing from. If you get an unavailable message try refreshing.*
